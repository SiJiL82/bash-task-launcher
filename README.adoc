== About
Task Launcher is a bash based CLI script that can be used to run a series of commonly run commands with a shorter alias. +
For example, if you regularly run the following commands to build and run your project:
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/projects/my_project/src
npm build-dev
npm start
----
You could create a Task Launcher task called `build-and-run` that contains these commands, and run them from anywhere in your shell by simply calling `tl build-and-run`.

Task Launcher also includes a CLI menu for all the tasks you've created, allowing you to execute the tasks available by entering their numeric input. +
The menu includes support for sub-menus, allowing you to group related tasks together.

== Getting Started
To start using Task Launcher, clone this repo: +
`git clone https://github.com/SiJiL82/bash-task-launcher.git`

If you want to create a task launcher with tasks for your existing project (for example to speed up common developer tasks),
clone this repo inside your project. +
You can change the launcher command to one relative to your project, which allows you to have a Task Launcher config specifically for your project. +
To do so, simply rename the `tl` file to whatever you want the command to be to call your launcher. +
For example, if you're working on "My Cool Website", you could rename `tl` to `mcw` which will allow you to call the launcher tasks with `mcw build-and-run`.  

=== Using the Launcher
To view available tasks the launcher can call, run any of `tl -h`, `tl h`, `tl help` or `tl --help`:

To run a task directly, simply call `tl` followed by the task name:

To launch the interactive menu, call `tl m` or `tl menu`:

You can then launch any of the tasks, or enter any of the sub menus by entering the numeric indicator next to the task description.
